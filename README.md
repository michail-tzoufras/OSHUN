# OSHUN: a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck code for High Energy Density Plasmas

An active repository for _OSHUN_ can be found <a href="https://github.com/UCLA-Plasma-Simulation-Group/OSHUN"> at PICKSC</a> along with a brief <a href="https://picksc.idre.ucla.edu/software/software-production-codes/oshun/"> description of the code</a>.

_OSHUN_ is a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck code _OSHUN_ between 2008-2011 as a post-doc working with Tony Bell in Oxford. The code is described in detailed in our  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999111002828">2011 JCP paper</a>. In a subsequent paper I wrote while at UCLA I discuss the updated version of the code along with some applications <a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4801750">2013 PoP paper</a>. 

In this repository, under OSHUN-1 you can find the version of the code used for the latter of the two papers. Under OSHUN-2 is the version I was working on when I left UCLA in 2013.

Archis Joglekar recently (2018) published a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6587/aab978"> PPCF paper</a> on the validation of OSHUN in various collisional and collisionless scenarios.
